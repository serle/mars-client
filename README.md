# Mars Explorer Client App

This project is a demonstration of my skills using modern React/Typescript together with Recoil and axios. 
I did not have time to focus on testing the client side but the server side of this project, developed in Java/Spring
Boot has fairly comprehensive testing. Time permitting, cypress tests will be added to this project.
